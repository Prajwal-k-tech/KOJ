## 1. Registration and Authentication

KOJ uses Clerk for secure account management.

- **Sign-up (`/sign-up`)**: Create an account using your email and password, or authenticate instantly using GitHub or Google OAuth.
- **Sign-in (`/sign-in`)**: Log into your existing account.
- **Profile Initialization**: Upon your first sign-in or submission, your contestant profile and database user record are automatically created.

You can browse problems and public contest details without signing in, but you must be signed in to submit solutions, run sample tests, register for contests, and view your personal dashboard.

---

## 2. Browsing the Problem Archive

The public problem archive is located at `/problems`. It contains problems available for open practice.

### Features and Filters
- **Search Bar**: Filter problems in real time by title or category.
- **Difficulty Badges**:
  - `Easy` (green)
  - `Medium` (yellow)
  - `Hard` (red)
- **Topic Filters**: Filter by subject areas such as `math`, `arrays`, `dp`, `graphs`, `strings`, etc.
- **Acceptance Rate**: Shows percentage of successful submissions across all participants.
- **Contestant Status Indicators**:
  - `● Solved` (green): You have solved this problem with an Accepted verdict.
  - `◐ Attempted` (yellow): You have submitted a solution, but have not yet achieved Accepted.
  - `○ Unsolved` (gray): You have not yet submitted a solution for this problem.

Click any problem row to open the full problem workspace.

## 3. Solving Problems

The problem interface (`/problems/[id]`) provides a split-view workspace with the problem statement on the left and the coding terminal on the right.

### Workspace Layout
- **Statement**: Full markdown problem description, input format, output format, constraints, and optional explanation notes.
- **Sample Cases**: Pre-configured sample inputs and expected outputs.
- **Resource Constraints**: Explicit per-case limits for CPU execution time (ms) and RAM memory (MB).

### Supported Programming Languages
Select your language from the dropdown menu in the code submission pane:
- **Python** (Python 3.11)
- **C** (GCC, `-O2`)
- **C++** (G++, `std=c++17`, `-O2`)
- **Java** (OpenJDK Headless)

Your code is read from standard input (`stdin`) and must write output to standard output (`stdout`).

### Submission Modes and Test Runner

The coding workspace features a 3-tab interactive testing panel:

| Tab | Purpose | Behavior | Impact on Standings |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sample Cases** | Multi-case sample evaluation | Runs against all public sample test cases. Displays per-case status badges (`✓` / `✗`), expected vs actual `stdout` diffs, execution time (ms), memory (MB), and `stderr` traces. | None (ephemeral) |
| **Custom Test** | Arbitrary `stdin` testing | Executes arbitrary user-supplied input against the judge runner. Supports optional expected output for custom diffing. Shows execution time, memory, stdout, and stderr without polluting submission history. | None (ephemeral) |
| **My Submissions** | In-workspace submission drawer | Lists your recent submissions on this problem with live verdict chips, execution stats, and click-to-view modal. Streams live verdict updates via SSE. | Real contest/archive submissions |

### Fast I/O Boilerplates & Templates
The editor includes pre-configured competitive programming starters:
- **C++**: Preloaded with `<bits/stdc++.h>`, fast I/O (`cin.tie(NULL)`, `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`), and standard typed main template.
- **Python**: Python 3.11 starter with `sys.stdin.read` fast input parsing.
- **Java**: Fast I/O using `BufferedReader` and `StringTokenizer`.
- **C**: Standard GCC 11 template.
- **Reset Code** and **Copy Code** buttons allow quick template restoration and clipboard copying.

## 4. Understanding Verdicts

After running or submitting code, KOJ displays a verdict along with the count of passed test cases and execution time:

| Verdict | Acronym | Meaning | Typical Causes & Solutions |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Accepted** | **AC** | Your solution passed all test cases within the resource limits. | Correct output across all test cases. |
| **Wrong Answer** | **WA** | Output produced by your program did not match expected output. | Logical bug, missed edge case, off-by-one errors, or incorrect formula. |
| **Time Limit Exceeded** | **TLE** | Solution exceeded the CPU time limit (e.g. 1000 ms). | Inefficient algorithm complexity (e.g., $O(N^2)$ instead of $O(N \log N)$), infinite loop, or slow I/O. |
| **Memory Limit Exceeded** | **MLE** | Solution allocated more RAM than the memory limit (e.g. 256 MB). | Creating overly large arrays or recursion depth causing memory exhaustion. |
| **Runtime Error** | **RE** | Program crashed during execution or exited with a non-zero code. | Division by zero, index out of bounds, null pointer dereference, or unhandled exception. |
| **Compilation Error** | **CE** | Code failed to compile. | Syntax error, missing header or import, or type mismatch. Compiler output is displayed in the response notice. (Note: CE does **not** incur penalty time in ICPC scoring). |
| **Presentation Error** | **PE** | Output content is logically correct, but whitespace/formatting differs. | Extra spaces at end of lines, missing newlines, or extra blank lines. |

## 5. Participating in Contests

Contests are organized at `/contests`.

### Contest Stages
1. **Upcoming**: Announced contest.
2. **Registration Open**: Registration is active; participants can register before contest start.
3. **Active**: The contest is live. Registered contestants can enter the arena and submit code.
4. **Finished**: The contest has concluded. Problems transition to the public archive and final standings are archived.

### Registration
- **Open Contests**: Click **REGISTER** to sign up.
- **Invite-Only Contests**: Enter the secret **Invite Code** distributed by organizers, then click **REGISTER NOW**.
- **Deadline**: Registration must be completed **before the contest starts** (`BR-06`). Once the clock begins, registration is closed.

### Countdown Timer
- Displays **starts in `HH:MM:SS`** prior to start.
- Displays **time remaining `HH:MM:SS`** while live.
- When the timer reaches zero, the page automatically refreshes to unlock the arena or finalize results.

### The Arena (`/contests/[id]/arena`)
When a contest is active and you are registered, click **ENTER ARENA** to open the live contest arena:
- Problems are letter-indexed (**A**, **B**, **C**, etc.) with distinctive **DOMjudge balloon color indicators** (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Cyan, Magenta, Purple, etc.).
- Submitting code from within the arena tags the submission with the `contestId`.
- Live standings reflect only submissions made during the contest window.

## 6. Leaderboard & DOMjudge ICPC Scoreboard

The contest standings are available at `/rankings?contestId=[id]` and update live during active contests via Server-Sent Events (SSE).

### Visual Elements (DOMjudge Style)
- **Problem Balloon Header**: Each problem column displays a circular balloon badge matching its assigned color palette.
- **First-to-Solve (First Blood)**: The earliest Accepted submission for each problem across the entire contest receives a dark green cell highlight and a gold star (`★`) badge.
- **Accepted Solves**: Highlighted in green showing `+attempts` and the elapsed time in minutes when solved (e.g., `+1 14'`).
- **Rejected Attempts**: Highlighted in red showing negative attempts (e.g., `-3`).
- **Pending / Scoreboard Freeze**: In the final 60 minutes of a live contest, submissions are masked in cyan with a `?` symbol and attempt count (e.g., `? 2`) to build suspense for the closing ceremony.
- **Summary Footer Row**: DOMjudge-style bottom row summarizing total accepted solutions and total attempts per problem.
- **Contestant Filter**: Live search input to filter standings by contestant username.

### ICPC Scoring Rules
1. **Rank Order**: Contestants are ranked primarily by **number of solved problems (descending)**.
2. **Tie-Breaking**: If contestants have solved the same number of problems, the contestant with the **lowest total penalty time (ascending)** is ranked higher.
3. **Penalty Calculation**:
   - **Penalty for a Solved Problem** = Time in minutes from contest start to your first Accepted (AC) submission + **20 minutes** for each rejected submission on that problem made prior to the first AC.
   - Example: You solve problem A at minute 35 after 2 Wrong Answers. Penalty for problem A = $35 + (2 \times 20) = 75$ minutes.
   - **Compilation Errors**: In accordance with official ICPC rules, compilation errors (`CE`) do **not** incur penalty minutes.
   - **Submissions after AC**: Subsequent submissions after solving a problem do not add penalty.
   - **Unsolved Problems**: If a problem is never solved, zero penalty is added for failed attempts on that problem.

## 7. Rate Limits and Policies

To ensure fair judging and system stability:
- **Rate Limit**: Maximum **1 submission every 30 seconds per problem** per user (`REQ-RATE-01/02`).
- Applies to both `RUN SAMPLE` and `SUBMIT` actions — both consume judge capacity.
- The submit button displays a live cooldown countdown (`WAIT 30s`).
- Attempting to bypass the cooldown results in an `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` error with a `Retry-After` header. Wait for the indicated time and retry.
- **Code Size Limit**: Submissions are limited to **100 KB** of source code.
